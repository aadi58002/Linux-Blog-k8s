## Points to learn Before installing
Emacs looks for `~/.emacs.d` folder which contains the file to configure it. It by default look for the `init.el` file in that folder.
::: tip el file extension
.el is the file extension of elisp files the language of emacs
:::
## Doom emacs
Doom emacs takes over the `~/.emacs.d` and it is recommened to not change files inside `~/.doom.d` instead a `~/.emacs.d` directory is used to configure the doom emacs framework.
## Installation
This is the offical way of install doom emacs.
:::warning
Make sure that there is no `~/.emacs.d` folder
:::
```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.emacs.d
~/.emacs.d/bin/doom install
```
## Personal Way
``` sh
export PATH="$PATH:~/.emacs.d/bin"                   # Add the doom command so that you can access it without full path

alias doomclone="git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d" # i Didn't want to remember the url each time

alias ke="killall -w emacs"                          # Kill emacs server and wait to emacs process to finish
alias fke="killall emacs"                            # Force kill emacs
alias e="emacsclient -c -a 'emacs' -q . & disown"    # e = emacs
alias ess="emacsclient -a '' -e '(server-start)'"    # ess = emacs server start
alias esr="killall -w emacs &&  doom sync && emacsclient -a '' -e '(server-start)'" # esr = emacs server restart
```

After pasting the above in your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` or `~/.config/fish/config.fish`. Open a new terminal and then write the below commands
``` sh
doomclone && doom install
```
> Answer yes to all questions ( it is mostly to install required fonts for doom emacs )
## Personal Recommended Config
Download Recommended Doom Config -> <a href="/config.zip" download>here</a>
> The above are good default for doom emacs which are in `my opinion` better to start with.

::: warning
If you already have a `~/.doom.d` either rename to something else or remove the directory
