## How to start Emacs
If you lanuch emacs like a normal application it is quite slow to say the least.  
What is the solution -> Always keep emacs open :laughing:.  
Well keeping a app always open seem weird but emacs follows a client and server relationship to mitigate the start time cost to just one time.  
You can start a emacs server with `emacsclient -a '' -e '(server-start)'`  
But now if you call the `emacs` command it will still open a emacs which does not connect to the server which was started ðŸ˜±.  
You will need to call `emacsclient -c -a '' & disown` which will create a graphical instance of emacs which connect to the emacs server.  

::: tip
You can copy the command alias which i use to start or restart emacs use [here](./Installation#personal-way)  
Then you can start emacs with `ess && emacsclient -c -a ''`

## Keybinding Convention
Some conventions for emacs keybinding are given below  
`M-x` -> It means the `alt key with x`  
`C-x`-> It means to press the `ctrl key with x`  
`X` -> It is just press `Shift with x`  
`C-e C-c` -> It means to first press `ctrl with e` and then press `ctrl with c`  
::: tip
The keys which are seperated by a space you can press them one by one you `don't` need to press all of them at the same time.

## Evil ( Or vim for emacs )
Doom emacs by default uses Vim keybinding.  
To learn about vim just just press `M-x` and then type evil-tutor-start and then press enter.  
It should open a guide like below

I Would recommend that you complete this until chapter 4 (including chapter 4).  
That would cover 70% of what you will do in terms of text editing in emacs.
